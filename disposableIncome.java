/*  SELF ASSESSMENT
   1. Did I use appropriate CONSTANTS instead of numbers within the code?
       Mark out of 10: 10  
       Comment: I used constants for the tax rate, and for the numbers that I used to convert between decimal and percent and the other way around.
        I also used them for constants relating to calculating the user's disposable compared to average.
        This allowed me to avoid having any unexplained numbers in my code.
   2. Did I format the variable and CONSTANT names properly (in lowerCamelCase and UPPERCASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES)? 
       Mark out of 10:  10
       Comment:  All of my constants were in uppercase with underscores between words and variables were in lower camel case.
   3. Did I indent the code appropriately?
       Mark out of 10:  10
       Comment: Code was indented to indicate the level of the line dependent on if statements.
   4. Did I read the input correctly from the user using appropriate questions?
       Mark out of 15:  15
       Comment: I asked the user accurate questions and read the input properly.
   5. Did I computer the disposable income and disposable income percentage correctly, and output it in the correct format? 
       Mark out of 15:  15
       Comment: I correctly computed the disposable income based on the equation provided, with post tax income calculated then fees being subtracted. I correctly calculated the disposable income percentage.
   6. Did I use an appropriate series of if statements to generate the income analysis to the user? 
       Mark out of 25: 25
       Comment: I used the correct if statements to generate analysis so that all of the possible analysies are applied correctly.
   10. Did I provide the correct output for each possibility in an easy to read format?
       Mark out of 10: 10
       Comment: I output the answer according to the easy-to-read format from the example, with the money having 2 decimal places and the percent to the nearest whole number.
   11. How well did I complete this self-assessment?
       Mark out of 5:  5
       Comment: I believe I accuraetly assessed my work in this self-assessment.
